#### Very basic challenge, similar in almost every aspect with [chasing a lock](https://blackbeard666.github.io/pwn_exhibit/content/2020_CTF/RaziCTF/android_lock/lock_writeup.html) that's why I won't go into full detail. Just read the linked writeup.

#### Flag: `RaziCTF{P4dL0CK5_4R3_FUN_T0_BR34K}`
