## Google CTF 2020: Android
> Can you find the correct key to unlock this app?
##### *tl;dr: a few minutes of reversing the algorithm, 5 hours for bruteforcing*

#### This challenge marked a lot of firsts for me as a CTF player: first time joining a team to compete with (OpenToAll) despite me being beginner-level at best and capturing a flag for them; first time I solved a main challenge from Google CTF (I assumed this was a non-beginner challenge since there were no beginner's quest challenges this year and this was not marked as easy in the challenge description). I had fun reversing, scripting a keygen for the challenge, and writing this writeup. For me, this is a milestone and one of the reasons for me to keep grinding, sharpening my skillset to be on par with the greatest players/teams in the world and hopefully be a decorated exploit developer in the near future.

### APK Static Analysis
#### Seeing that we were given an apk to reverse, my plan was to first decompile the apk with jadx-gui and have a peek at the source code. If there were interesting stuff that were referenced but not included in the result, I would then open the apk with apktool. The following 86 lines of code are what seems to be the MainActivity file for the application.
