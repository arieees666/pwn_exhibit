## DarkCON CTF: Intro

![](score.png)

#### I participated in the darkcon ctf which happened last weekend. Despite solving only 5 challenges (2 pwn, 1 rev, 1 osint, 1 misc), I managed to still place 112th. Sadly the contest was only held for one day. I have secured the challenge files, and will try to attempt solving them since I have enjoyed the challenges. 

#### For now, I'll only be posting the exploit scripts + a summary of what needs to be done. If I complete doing my schoolworks, I'll try to create more detailed writeups.
