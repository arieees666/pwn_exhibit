##### *tl;dr: format string vulnerability to overwrite printf GOT*
#### As with the other pwn challenges, the source codes are given - making the vulnerability finding process much easier:
```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void flag() {
	system("/bin/cat flag.txt");
}

int main() {
	gid_t gid = getegid();
	setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
	setvbuf(stdin, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
	setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);

	char item[60];
	printf("What item would you like to purchase? ");
	fgets(item, sizeof(item), stdin);
	item[strlen(item)-1] = 0;

	if (strcmp(item, "nothing") == 0) {
		printf("Then why did you even come here? ");
	} else {
		printf("You don't have any money to buy ");
		printf(item);
		printf("s. You're wasting your time! We don't even sell ");
		printf(item);
		printf("s. Leave this place and buy ");
		printf(item);
		printf(" somewhere else. ");
	}

	printf("Get out!\n");
	return 0;
}
```
#### Taking a quick look at the source code, we quickly spot the vulnerability which is the printf function being called without format specifiers (`printf(item);`). What this means is that printf interprets buffer as a format string, and parses any formatting instructions it may contain - thus leading to code executions and memory leaks. 
#### A format string exploit could be executed when the application doesnâ€™t properly validate the submitted input. For example, if a format string parameter, like %x, is inserted into the posted data, the string is parsed by the format function, and the conversion specified in the parameters is executed. However, the format function is expecting more arguments as input, and if these arguments are not supplied, the function could read or write the stack. 
#### To have a better understanding of how we will exploit this challenge, here are quick links to `LiveOverflow`'s videos on format string exploitation:

#### Examining the source code again, we see that there is is a flag function which prints out the flag for us. Taking a note of this, our exploit plan will be to take advantage of the format string vulnerability to overwrite puts' `GOT address` to the flag function - thus making puts execute what flag does. To test if our plan would work, we try it out in gdb. We set a breakpoint before the puts call, then change the it's GOT address to the address of flag:
```
$ gdb ./purchases
	gdb-peda$ disas printf

```
#### To talk you through what just happened, first we disassembled the puts function and saw that the first thing it does is to jump to it's GOT entry address, `0x404018`. Now that we have the GOT address for puts, we printed out the address for flag, set a breakpoint before our puts call. After we hit the breakpoint, we set the contents of the GOT address to flag's address, then we validate if we have successfully overwriten the value. Continuing the process, the binary executes /bin/dash and proceeds to call the flag function.
